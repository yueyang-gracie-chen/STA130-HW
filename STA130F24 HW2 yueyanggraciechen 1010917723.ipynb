    "Topic: Markovian Chatbot Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "You shared a Python code snippet that creates a \"Markovian Chatbot\" using a simple Markov chain model. The goal of the code is to analyze a sequence of words and build a predictive model for the next word based on the current word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the detailed breakdown of the code I provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two dictionaries are initialized:\n",
    "word_used: Tracks how many times each word appears in the dataset.\n",
    "next_word: Tracks how often each word follows the current word in the dataset.\n",
    "Loop Over Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code loops through all words in a list called words, except the last one. For each word:\n",
    "It updates word_used to count how often the word appears.\n",
    "It updates next_word to store what words follow the current word and how often.\n",
    "Explanation of Dictionary Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a word has already been encountered, its count in word_used is incremented; otherwise, it is added to word_used with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "Similarly, for each word, its \"next word\" is tracked in next_word. If a \"next word\" has been encountered before, its count is incremented; otherwise, it's added with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "Code Summary:\n",
    "Input: A list of words (stored in words).\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "word_used: Frequency of each word in the input list.\n",
    "next_word: Dictionary mapping each word to the words that follow it and how often each follow-up word appears.\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "Markov Chain: This chatbot is based on a Markov chain, meaning it predicts the next word based on the current word. It doesn't account for any longer-term context.\n",
    "Dictionaries: These are used to store both the frequency of words and the frequency of word sequences."

So it was difficult to look at some lines with long code, and chatgpt didn't give a specific explanation for those lines, which made me a little helpless, but I later found out that was because I didn't prompt it to give me a line-by-line explanation, after I asked it, chatgpt gave me a satisfactory answer and helped me understand the long code.\n",

    "Since joining the course, my perception of AI-driven assistance tools in the context of learning coding, statistics, and data science has evolved significantly. Before i took STA130, chatgpt was always a symbol of academic plagiarism in my mind, so i never used it while studying or doing assignments, and for research or other confusion come from my daily life, i was more willing to use bing. or google. So, i literally didn't have any perception of AI-driven assistance tools till the first tutorial of STA130 which really shocked me at first that we could use chatgpt for studying?! However, through these two weeks' exploration, i found myself misunderstood the role of AI tools in this course before and i gradually began to build my own perception to AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-driven assistance tools have brought so many benefits:\n",
    "1.Promote independent learning\n",
    "By chatting with AI tools like chatgpt, students can learn independently anytime and anywhere without being resticted by the class schedule. In addition, AI tools can provide access to a massive store of information, which helps in exploring new libraries, coding frameworks, or statistical techniques out of the course, to broader our knowledge.\n",
    "2.Promote personalized instruction\n",
    "AI tools can personalize a learning guidance for students targeted to their questions and interests through interacting. For me, i significantly benefited from this for the past two weeks. As i didn't have any coding or programming experience before and my language is still on the way, i cannot always catch up in lectures. If this situation happenned before AI tools were invented, i couldn't imagine how struggling i would be. But now, even if it's still challenging for me to handle all codes we've learnt in class as soon as possible, i can ask chatgpt to help me explain the code line by line, which makes me less painful.\n",
    "3.Efficiency for problem-solving\n",
    "Before using AI tools to clear my confusion, every time i spent a large amount of time searching through google and reading all articles i thought they would help, which was a big project and time-consuming. However, by chatting with AI tools, they can directly provide me related helpful metarials or directly clearly explain my confusion. This observably avoids users wasting time on unnecessary reading and improve the learning efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, i also recognized the shortcoming of AI tools:\n",
    "1.Information overloaded\n",
    "Students who lack of discernability may find it difficult to distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of the huge amount of content generated by AI tools and its fast updating speed, especially when students even do not clearly understand their existing information. In this situation, students will feel overwhelming and might be affected by misleading information. \n",
    "2.Generate dependency\n",
    "Long-term reliance on content generated by AI tools may weaken's students' creativity and priority for data/code analysis, because they are used to accepting ready-made answers instead of using their own brain to think or explore innovative ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, AI tool is a double-edged sword. We should definitely use AI-drivin assistance tools helping us learning coding and data science efficiently and effectively, but we also need to remind ourselves all the time that AI tools are just kind of tools, they cannot manipulate our own thinking and we cannot use them to substitute our brains. AI and human brains must work together to promote the development of science and technology.\n"
